- Disease Detector 📌 Overview

Disease Predictor is a machine learning project. The model learns from patient data and predicts if a person is likely to have heart disease or not.

This project uses machine learning libraries and it uses machine learning libraries to train and test models.

🚀 Features

Clean and prepare health-related datasets.
Training machine learning models for disease prediction.
Evaluates with accuracy and metrics.
Exports trained model for reuse.
Runs everything in Jupyter Notebook.

⚙️ Technologies Used 

Built with Python 3.x using NumPy.
Pandas for data handling.
Scikit-learn for ML, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
Joblib for saving models and to load it later to make predictions without re-running the whole notebook.

 💻 Installation 

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/satyasairaj/Diseaseprediction.git
cd Diseaseprediction 

Create a virtual environment (recommended): python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage 

Open Colab Notebook: Run the Disease_Detector.ipynb file step by step.

Train the model and generate predictions.

(Optional) Use the saved model (.pkl file) for deployment in other applications.

📊 Workflow

Load & preprocess data. Train ML model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression). Evaluate performance (accuracy, confusion matrix). Save model for reuse.

 🔮Future Improvements

Build a Streamlit Web App for user-friendly interaction . Expand dataset to more diseases. Try Deep Learning for better accuracy. Deploy on cloud platforms.
