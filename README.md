- Disease Detector 📌 Overview

Disease Predictor is a machine learning project. The model learns from patient data and predicts if a person is likely to have heart disease or not.

This project uses machine learning libraries and it uses machine learning libraries to train and test models.

🚀 Features

Clean and prepare health-related datasets.
Train machine learning models for disease prediction.
Evaluate with accuracy and metrics.
Export trained model for reuse.
Run everything in Jupyter Notebook.

⚙️ Technologies Used 

Built with Python 3.x using NumPy.
Pandas for data handling 
Scikit-learn for ML, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
Joblib for saving models and to load it later to make predictions without re-running the whole notebook.
