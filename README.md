- Disease Detector 📌 Overview

Disease Predictor is a machine learning project. The model learns from patient data and predicts if a person is likely to have heart disease or not.

This project uses machine learning libraries and it uses machine learning libraries to train and test models.

🚀 Features

● Clean and prepare health-related datasets.
● Train machine learning models for disease prediction.
● Evaluate with accuracy and metrics.
● Export trained model for reuse.
● Run everything in Jupyter Notebook.

⚙️ Technologies Used 

● Built with Python 3.x using NumPy
● Pandas for data handling 
● Scikit-learn for ML, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
● Joblib for saving models and to load it later to make predictions without re-running the whole notebook.
